# Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python 
# Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function 


# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
# 1.   Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
# 2.   Returns the calculated factorial.
# 3.   Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.



# def factorial(n):
#     fact = 1
#     for i in range (1,n+1):
#         fact *= i
#     return fact
# num = int(input("enter a number: "))
# print("factorial of the entered number is: ",factorial(num))



# Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
 
# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
# 1.   Asks the user for a number as input.
# 2.   Uses the math module to calculate the:
#           Square root of the number
#           Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
#           Sine of the number (in radians)
# 3.   Displays the calculated results.
