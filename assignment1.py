# b = int(input("enter second number : "))

# sum = (a + b)
# sub = (a - b)
# mul = (a * b)
# div = (a / b)

# print ("sum of numbers: ",sum)
# print ("subtraction of numbers: ",sub)
# print ("multiplicaiton of numbers: ",mul)
# print ("division of numbers: ", div)

# Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting
# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
# 1.  Takes a user's first name and last name as input.
# 2.  Concatenates the first name and last name into a full name.
