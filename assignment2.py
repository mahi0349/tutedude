# ASSIGNMENT 2:
# Module 3: Control Structures in Python
 
# Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
# Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:
# 1. 	Takes an integer input from the user.
# 2. 	Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
# 3. 	Displays the result accordingly.
# 

# num = int(input("enter a number : "))

# if(num % 2 == 0):
#     print("number is even.")
# else:
#     print("number is odd.")


# Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
 
# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
# 1.   Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
# 2.   Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
# 3.   Displays the final sum.

# i = 0


# for sum in range(1 , 51):
#     i += sum

# print("total sum of num from 1 to 50 is:",i)
